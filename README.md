### How do you get started?

1. get a tessel2 and usb to usb-mini cable, plug it into your computer
1. Have (Node.js)[https://nodejs.org/] installed locally (v4.2.x or greater according to the tessel website)
1. Open the command line and install `t2-cli` with npm or yarn for example
    * `$ yarn global add t2-cli`
    * `$ npm install -g t2-cli`
1. Find and rename your tessel2:

    ```sh
    t2 list
    t2 rename Tessel-Emily
    t2 list
    ```

1. Init a basic project and "hello ~world~ blinky"

    * `$ mkdir tessel2FunTimes`
    * `$ git init` because of course
    * `$ t2 init` and check out the autogenerated new stuff
    * Rename index.js to app.js: file and in package.json (optional, but makes more sense to me)
    * `$ t2 run app.js` to see it work on the board
    * `$ t2 push app.js` to load it on the board and have the code run when tessel is not connected to your computer
    * `$ t2 erase` to remove loaded code from the tessel
